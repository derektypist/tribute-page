# Derek Dhammaloka Tribute Page

Welcome to my tribute page.  The purpose of this project is to provide a tribute page of myself.  An image is provided.  A link to an outside site
that contains additional information about myself is provided.

It is in a similar style to https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx

## UX

The tribute page provides my name, slogan, image (including caption) and information.

The tribute information consists of year and milestone (e.g. Passed Driving Test at Sidcup, Kent).  Organising principle is timeline.

Users can see a timeline of my milestones, which include computing, travel, education and other personal things (e.g. Attended First Horse Race Meeting in Epsom, Surrey).
They can go to a link that contains additional information about myself without leaving the tribute page.  The link is coloured green.  Hovering over the link, the colour
changes to fuchsia and a screentip (View Details) is displayed.

As a user, I would like to see the img element responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
The max-width is set to 100%.

I would like to see the img element centered within its parent element.  Display is set to block and margin is set to auto.

[Wireframes](wireframes/wireframe-tribute-page.png) are provided.

## Features

Responsive Image, Link to External Web Page and Timeline.

## Technologies

This project uses HTML5 with CSS3 (Internal).  Other technologies include https://fonts.google.com to faciliate the use of Font Roboto.  Alternative fonts
(e.g. Arial, Verdana) are available.


## Testing

Go to https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/pen/MJjpwO, select Test Suite (Tribute Page) and select Run Tests.  Make sure all the tests have passed.
If some have failed, go back and edit the code (e.g. max-width: 100%) until all the tests have passed.

Resize the width of the browser window to see the img element responsively resize.  Manually check the links to ensure that they are pointing to the correct
destination.  Links to external web pages should open in a new window.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub pages at https://derektypist.github.io/tribute-page, using the master branch.
