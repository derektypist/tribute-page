# Derek Dhammaloka Tribute Page

Welcome to my tribute page.  The purpose of this project is to provide a tribute page of myself.  A link to an outside site
that contains additional information about myself is to be provided.

It is in a similar style to https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx

## UX

The tribute information consists of year and milestone (e.g. Passed Driving Test at Sidcup, Kent).  

## Features

## Technologies

This project uses HTML5 with CSS3 (Internal).  Other technologies include https://fonts.google.com to faciliate the use of Font Roboto.  Alternative fonts
(e.g. Arial, Verdana) are available.


## Testing
